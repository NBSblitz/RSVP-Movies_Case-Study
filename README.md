# RSVP-Movies_Case-Study
Analyzed the data encompassing RSVP Movies' releases within the last three years, employing SQL for analysis, and provided the company with strategic recommendations derived from the insights gained.

Executive Summary:
1. Over half of the movies released in 2019 were launched in India and the US.
2. Months such as March, September, October, and January witnessed over 800 movie releases.
3. Movie releases from April to July showed a decreasing trend, while December had the fewest releases. Hence, RSVP could schedule their movie releases during this period to minimize competition.
4. Drama, Comedy, and Thriller emerged as the top three genres.
5. Considering that the number of thrillers produced is nearly half of dramas, RSVP might consider focusing on Thrillers or Comedies (which amount to about a quarter of Drama movies) to reduce competition.
6. Potential production companies for RSVP's next project could be Dream Warrior Pictures (Ranked 1st) or National Theatre Live (Ranked 2nd). Global partnerships could involve "Marvel Studios," "Twentieth Century Fox," or "Warner Bros."
7. Recommended directors include James Mangold, who has the most movies with better average ratings, or Antony/Joe Russo.
8. Based on median ratings, Mammootty (Ranked 1st) or Mohanlal (Ranked 2nd) could be considered for the Actor role in their next project.
9. Considering total votes and average ratings, Taapsee Pannu (Ranked 1st) or Kriti Sanon (Ranked 2nd) could be chosen as the actress for their next project.
10. Additional actors such as Vijay Sethupathi and Fahaad Faasil could be considered based on total votes. Vijay Sethupathi might bring diversity while Fahaad Faasil could add a regional touch.
